L02: Well Al B. Sorted
2021-12-13

DISCO:
0. In ALTester, we need to make two versions of each method (populate() and sorted()) for Ordered Array List and ArrayList<Integer> because two different variable types.

QCC:
0. What are "unsafe" operations?
1. addBinary() is tricky... a lot of trials but many more errors. 
  - addLinear works fine
  - when we compile addBinary(), there are no compile errors but it takes a long time to return the array...
  indicating that it's probably wrong
  - why does the first element not comply with sorted; i.e. why is it not in order???? 
  - why do the outputs not change even when we change the code :(((((

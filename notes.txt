- In ALTester, we need to make two versions of each method (populate() and sorted()) for Ordered Array List and ArrayList<Integer>.

- Methods we don't have to refactor:
  - toString()
  - remove()
  - size()
  - get()
  
- Methods to Refactor:
  - addLinear()
  - addBinary()
  
- addBinary() is tricky... a lot of trials but many more errors. 
  - addLinear works fine
  - when we compile addBinary(), there are no compile errors but it takes a long time to return the array...
  indicating that it's probably wrong
  - why does the first element not comply with sorted; i.e. why is it not in order???? 
  - why do the outputs not change even when we change the code :(((((
